# The purpose 
The main reason I create the Folder python_package is to store all sorts of python packages. 
I wanna use different branches to store all the tutorials of packages, they won't never merge to the main.

The first one is Numpy, the second one should be Matplotlib.

The third one should be Pandas, the fourth one could be pytorch.

I will keep trying some machine learning package to implement some models.



The subprocess module can make you run Linux command within Python and pass the output in whatever you want, like post-process the output or storing the result somewhere.
